        <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
        <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
            It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
            Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa Camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. 
            Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 
            and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns.
             Six valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record. </p>
     <p>
        Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes.
         Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups. 
         Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. 
         Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.
