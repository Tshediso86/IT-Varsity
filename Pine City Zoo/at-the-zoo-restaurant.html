    Ancient Greek theatres were typically built on hillsides and semi-circular in design. 
    The first amphitheatre may have been built at Pompeii around 70 BC.
     Ancient Roman amphitheatres were oval or circular in plan, with seating tiers that surrounded the central performance area, like a modern open-air stadium. 
    In contrast, both ancient Greek and ancient Roman theatres were built in a semicircle, with tiered seating rising on one side of the performance area.
