        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. 
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. 
            Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms. </p>
     <p>
        Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecoidea in the Catarrhine, so cladistical they are monkeys as well. However, there has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, 
        so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhine (including apes).
        , That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. 
        Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a single genus "Simia" (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognized as the Haplorrhine.
Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.
